## The Project

This project has been the introduction to react-router to me. I've learned the basics of the router and how to use it in the project. Basically, the project consists of several routes which user can decide to scroll. There is two buttons one for the menu and the other one to always direct page to home page. On click of menu button, modal window with several route options will be opened and then user can navigate through the pages.  

I have used react-semantic-ui for the styles. As the content didn't really matter in this project, I've faked react-semantic-ui's page sections which made it easy for me to have a fancy styles without too much work. 

## Challenges

This was a simple project and didn't really made any trouble to me. Learning fundamentals of react-router-dom is the essential skills that I've gained along this project.
