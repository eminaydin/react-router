## The Project

This project has been the introduction to react-router to me. I've learned the basics of the router and how to use it in the project. This is very simple project where I have a navigation bar and depending on the click I change the route and direct user to that specific page.

For the sake of better UI experience basic styling has been made. To check out the live version please see the link here : https://reactrouterapp.netlify.app/
